## Question 1

Find a DEM dataset in the [Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/), clip the DEM to your home state, and display the DEM with a proper color palette on the map. For example, the sample map below shows the DEM of the state of Colorado.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import ee
import geemap
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add your code here.
```

## Question 2

Use [Sentinel-2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2) or [Landsat-9 data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/landsat-9), create a cloud-free imagery of the year 2021 for your home state. Display the imagery on the map with a proper band combination. For example, the sample map below shows a cloud-free false-color composite of Sentinel-2 imagery of the year 2021 for the state of Colorado.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Add your code here.
